### document-analyzer

- This appears to be an **initial import** of the full repo — 52 files, 9 110 lines added in a single range from an empty tree (`4b825dc6..2115578c`), covering everything from Phase 0 bootstrap through Phase 11.
- Core work across the range: built three LLM document-querying strategies (naive, chunking, divide-and-conquer) against the Gemini API, with a shared `RateLimitedLLMClient`, 429/5xx retry logic with `RetryInfo` parsing, and timing decomposed into `apiLatencyMs / backoffMs / localCpuMs` (`72e0d44`).
- Operational hardening added a pre-flight call-count budget gate (`--unsafe-skip-budget-check` / `GEMINI_RPM`), fault-tolerant `Promise.allSettled` fan-out, `--paced` sequential mode, and run-state persistence with `--resume <runId>` for quota-interrupted runs (`e0fdfb9`, `9e6b61a`).
- Test coverage is substantial: 155 unit tests + a live integration suite (Gemini client field-population, per-strategy invariants, tiktoken drift guard) with a shared rate-limited client across strategy `beforeAll`s to stay within the 5 RPM free-tier ceiling (`0bb7381`, `2d35e37`).
- As of the last commit (`2115578`), Phase 11 task 29 (cross-strategy non-identity check) is drafted and staged but unverified — daily quota exhausted before D&C's `beforeAll` could complete; pickup deferred to quota reset.
